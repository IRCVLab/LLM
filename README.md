- Camera and LiDAR calibration support
- Easy-to-use graphical interface

## üî® Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Execution

```bash
python main.py
```

## üìÑ Documentation
This version supports the **OpenLane V1** format and requires *images*, *PCD files*, and *camera and lidar calibration files*.

#### Data
- Put your images in `data/image/image` folder.
- Put your pcd files in `data/image/pcd` folder.
- Put your calibration files in `calibration` folder. (`r.txt`, `t.txt`, `k.txt`, `distortion.txt`)

#### Usage

1. Run `python main.py`
2. Choose the class of lane. 
3. Click the point you want to label on the left image or the right  window.
4. Click the 'Add Lane' button. Also, you can delete the points and lane by clicking the 'Delete' button.
5. Click the 'Save' button to save the label or 'Next' button to save and move to the next image. (`data/label `folder)

- You can use keyboard shortcuts to add, delete, move and so on..
