```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Execution

```bash
python main.py
```

## üìÑ Documentation
This version supports the **OpenLane V1** format and requires *images*, *PCD files*, and *camera and lidar calibration files*.

#### Usage

1. Put your images and pcd files in `data/image/image` and `data/image/pcd` folder.
2. Put your calibration files in `calibration` folder. (`r.txt`, `t.txt`, `k.txt`, `distortion.txt`)
3. Run `python main.py`
4. Choose the class in the right panel.
5. Click the point you want to label in the left image.
6. Click the 'Add Lane' button. Also, you can delete the points and lane by clicking the 'Delete' button.
7. Click the 'Save' button to save the label. (`data/label `folder)
